# Filianify-Youtube-Enhanced

Are you a snacker? Maybe even a smacker?
Add [Filian](https://twitch.tv/filian) to your YouTube video thumbnails!

</div>

This is an updated and enhanced version of the Firefox extension [Filianify Youtube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/filianify-youtube/), which itself is a fork of [MrBeastify-Youtube](https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube/).

The purpose of this updated and enhanced version is to include newer patches from MrBeastify-Youtube as well as add more overlay pictures.

*I left the Ko-Fi button on the UI for the MrBeastify-Youtube creator. This is a reskin DLC and I'm not Ubisoft; support the original creator that did the work, not me.*
